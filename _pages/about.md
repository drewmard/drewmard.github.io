Hello!

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in [Dr. Stephen Montgomery's lab](https://smontgomlab.github.io/index.html) at Stanford University. My research focuses on using single-cell multi-omics and genome-wide association studies to implicate molecular mechanisms in disease.

Previously, I received my B.S. from Cornell University in [Biometry & Statistics](https://cals.cornell.edu/education/degrees-programs/biometry-statistics-major-and-minor), with a minor in Biological Sciences and a concentration in Statistical Genomics. During undergraduate, I completed an Honorâ€™s Thesis in population genetics as a part of [Philipp Messer's group](https://messerlab.org/) and was a statistical genetics intern at the [Regeneron Genetics Center](https://www.regeneron.com/genetics-center) for two summers in Tarrytown, NY. After graduating, I pursued a PhD in the [Tri-Institutional Computational Biology & Medicine program](https://compbio.triiprograms.org/), where I researched the genetic basis of human disease using computational and statistical approaches within the labs of [Olivier Elemento](https://elementolab.weill.cornell.edu/) and [Andy Clark](https://blogs.cornell.edu/andyclarklab/) at Cornell's [NYC](https://eipm.weill.cornell.edu/) and [Ithaca](https://cb.cornell.edu/) campuses.

Long-term, my interests are to use human genetic and multi-omic datasets for (1) therapeutic target discovery, by discovering new genetic associations and their underlying mechanisms; (2) precision medicine, by personalizing treatment regimens based on molecular alterations, and (3) interventive and preventive care, by identifying high-risk individuals for screening & other preventive strategies. I believe we need better conceptual approaches for understanding the genotype-to-phenotype map; as a result, my current research spans both basic and more translational research areas.
