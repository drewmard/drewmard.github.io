Hello!

I am a Research Fellow at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the [Clinical Genetics Service](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/risk-assessment-screening/genetic-counseling-and-testing), led by [Dr. Kenneth Offit](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/doctors/kenneth-offit). My research focuses on identifying the cellular and molecular mechanisms driven by genetic factors, with the ultimate goal of discovering actionable insights for patient treatment.

As a [School of Medicine Dean's Postdoctoral Fellow](https://postdocs.stanford.edu/current/fellowship/deans) at Stanford University in [Dr. Stephen Montgomery's lab](https://smontgomlab.github.io/index.html), I analyzed the largest single-cell multi-omic dataset of fetal Down Syndrome hematopoiesis (with [Dr. Ana Cvejic](https://www.bric.ku.dk/research-groups/Research/cvejic-group/), University of Copenhagen). I discovered a potential mechanistic link between a reshaped chromatin landscape and clinical abnormalities (such as the 150-fold increased risk of childhood leukemia or increased red blood cell counts), which is currently in press at *Nature*. Additionally, I applied deep learning models to predict the cell-type-specific regulatory effects of both rare and common non-coding variants (with [Soumya Kundu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumya-kundu/) & [Dr. Anshul Kundaje](https://kundajelab.stanford.edu/), [ASHG](https://www.ashg.org/meetings/) Presentations ’22, ’24) while leading computational and organizational initiatives within the [IGVF Consortium](https://www.genome.gov/news/news-release/NIH-providing-185-million-dollars-for-research-to-advance-understanding-of-how-human-genome-functions).

Previously, I received my B.S. from Cornell University in [Biometry & Statistics](https://cals.cornell.edu/education/degrees-programs/biometry-statistics-major-and-minor), with a minor in Biological Sciences and a concentration in Statistical Genomics. During undergraduate, I completed an Honor’s Thesis in population genetics as a part of [Philipp Messer's group](https://messerlab.org/) and was a statistical genetics intern at the [Regeneron Genetics Center](https://www.regeneron.com/genetics-center) for two summers in Tarrytown, NY. After graduating, I pursued a PhD in the [Tri-Institutional Computational Biology & Medicine program](https://compbio.triiprograms.org/), where I researched the genetic basis of human disease using computational and statistical approaches within the labs of [Olivier Elemento](https://elementolab.weill.cornell.edu/) and [Andy Clark](https://blogs.cornell.edu/andyclarklab/) at Cornell's [NYC](https://eipm.weill.cornell.edu/) and [Ithaca](https://cb.cornell.edu/) campuses.

Long-term, my interests are to use human genetic and multi-omic datasets for (1) therapeutic target discovery, by discovering new genetic associations and their underlying mechanisms; (2) precision medicine, by personalizing treatment regimens based on molecular alterations, and (3) interventive and preventive care, by identifying high-risk individuals for screening & other preventive strategies. I believe we need better conceptual approaches for understanding the genotype-to-phenotype map; as a result, my current research spans both basic and more translational research areas.
